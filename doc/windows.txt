After the package has been installed you must install some ROMs and a
bootable disk image if emulating a disk model.

The minimal requirement is a character ROM and either a disk boot or BASIC
ROMs depending on what models are to be emulated.

ROMs and disk images are not supplied with uBee512. See doc\quickstart.txt
or the doc\INSTALL file for further details.

Adding an executable path: If you want to run the emulator from a command
line prompt from any directory then you must add the path containing the
ubee512.exe executable to the path environment variable.

The information provided here is found in doc\windows.txt
